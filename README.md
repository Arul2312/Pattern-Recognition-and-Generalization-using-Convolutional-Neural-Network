****1.1 Problem Statement****
Pattern Recognization and Generalization on ARC Dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks

****1.2 Hypothesis****
Increasing the number of layers in a convolutional neural network can lead to higher training errors in small or simple datasets due to overparameterization or overfitting regularization effects.
